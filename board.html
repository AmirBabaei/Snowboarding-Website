					I am Amir Babaei, born in Paris in April 1994. when I was 4, I went back to Iran where I spent most of my life. growing up my youngest uncle was my role model. I like doing to be like him, in every single aspect. when I was 10 he started to skiing regularly. when he would come back on the weekends, he would tell me how amazing the experience was. I never experience that joy until my uncle took me to heavenly ski resort 10 years after. that's when I realized. Ski and snowboarding are not just a physical sport. When you stand on top of the hill and look at the beautiful nature in complete silence, you stop thinking about everything and enjoy the view. This feeling in indescribable and that is the reason you need to experience it yourself. I am great full that my uncle for helping me experience this feeling, and I hope you experience this feeling if you haven't yet.
